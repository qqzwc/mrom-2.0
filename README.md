# MultiROM "2.0"

This is yet another fork of MultiROM, one-of-a-kind multi-boot solution.
It's capable of booting a second android ROM while keeping the first one intact,
the second ROM can be stored in the internal memory or even in a USB flash drive.
Another capability of MultiROM is booting non-Android ROMs like Ubuntu Touch.

### Building

Coming soon, uses LineageOS 13.0 tree with the latest TWRP.
